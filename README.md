Making random inputs of data into sonud


Purpose of project is to allow a way to create a music generator from random data. The fun comes in where you can manipulate the "base"
of the numeral system so that you can experiment with different rules and bases and theorize how random data is most optimally converted
into sound. 

The theory behind this is that the mass proponderance of data cannont be understood "Synergetically" (to put it the way Buckminster Fuller might have)
except through the lens of some perfectly subjective material. Neural networks are great for some things but sometimes you just need
math and noise. This program seeks to provide the sandbox for that exploration and understanding.

Iteration I.

- only accepting inputs of binary files such as images (the most reliable input for organically random data). 
- will default to Base -16 and a very specific configuration of Base 16 where [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] are C->G major scale and [7,8,9,A,B] are the flat and sharp
augmentations of those values (think of a piano, starting with low B) and [C,D] and [E,F will be a boolean for up octave and down octave. 
- Intuitive GUI for presenting these calculations in as attracive a manner to the eye as they hopefully sound to the ear. At least we can keep one thing
objectively constant. 

Iteration II.

- Should allow all file types. 
- allow for the change in base numeral system as well as specific designation on what numbers and/or range of numbers indicate ocatving. 
- Allow all Major scales and Natural Minor scales.
- Allow you to save the different midi files off on to your desktop and allow you to generate and print the sheet music for the file you just listened to. 
- A hopefully more attractive and usable GUI. Maybe I'll learn JQuery for this or something. Who cares. 

Iteration III.

- allow for individual number-> note assignment with a limited range of notes. Maybe limited to the conventional 88 keyboard. If it's good enough 
for Chopin, it's good enough for you. 
- Harmonic Minor and Melodic Minor scales included
- An even more attractive GUI, if that's possible at this point. 

Interation IV. 

- the allowance of "rules" or custom scripting to interface with the current module. This is dangerous but nothing ever worth doing was without risk.
- the allowance of multiple keyboards or "hands" on keyboards so that we can be released into the pleaseure of the harmony. 
- The hope is that by this time Google will have brought about the singularity and we will have transcended the need for GUI's. If not maybe we'll provide the ability to mix and match "rules" placed on different files at different points, allowing for music that doesn't sound terrible.
